# AutomataTheory
Projects from CSMC-410 fall 2024

All of these projects read from corresponding .txt files to build the corresponding machine. 
Example files are included. 
Files typically follow this format:

number of states
accepting state/s
transitions...

Each project is made up of the "builders": TuringMachine.java, PDABuilder.java, and DFAbuilder.java
and the state classes: TMState.java, PDAState.java, and DFAState.java.

when running the programs compile each builder with its matching state class
input files are hardcoded in, so if you wish to change the machine, you will need to change the input file.
